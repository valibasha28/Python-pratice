    "Procedure-oriented programming (POP), which consists of a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do; these instructions are then organized into functions. The program is divided into a collection of variables, data structures, and routines to accomplish different tasks. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means it supports different programming approach. One different way to program in Python is object-oriented programming (OOP). The learning curve is steeper, but it is extremely very powerful and worth the time invested in mastering it. Note: you do not have to use OOP when programming in Python. You can still write very powerful programs using the POP. That said, the POP is good for simple and small programs, while the OOP is better suited for large programs. Let us take a closer look at object-oriented programming."

For parent class Accelerometer and child class UCBAcc, they both have a method named show_type, but they have different implementation. This ability of using single name with many forms acting differently in different situations greatly reduces our complexities.
